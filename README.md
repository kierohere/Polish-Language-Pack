Polish Language Pack is a mod that adds high-quality Polish translations to mods that lack them. The focus is on major mods like *BetterEnd*, *BetterNether*, *Deeper and Darker* etc. The translations are carefully crafted to match Mojang's official Polish localization style, ensuring an accurate and immersive experience for Polish players.

Originally designed for my personal modpack, the mod is now available publicly on Modrinth, so anyone who wants to enjoy mods in proper Polish can download it and play. This project addresses the issue of poorly translated content from platforms like Crowdin, offering a polished alternative for the community.
